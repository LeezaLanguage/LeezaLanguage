- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeezaLanguage
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to understand coding languages better (IDK if that even makes any sense, but it's like the logic side of it)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on n/a; I am just starting out but would love to work on smt when I become more fluent
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached on rakitinelizabeth@gmail.com, but I don't really see why lol :)
